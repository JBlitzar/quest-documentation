Documentation on quest project

Click in: README should have a brief description of the project, while NOTES should detail my process. Look for images in a results/ folder, and I will put images in the README eventually.

- JBlitzar/Text2Image -- Text to Image Diffusion Model:

  - I coded a text to image diffusion model from scratch in Python with Pytorch.

  - https://github.com/JBlitzar/Text2Image/blob/main/wrapper.py

- JBlitzar/genetic-graphs -- Genetic Graphs Neural Architecture Search System:

  - Uses genetic algorithms to construct and evolve neural networks represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs in order to determine the optimal architecture. Coded from scratch in Python with Pytorch, utilizing the Pytorch Lightning training framework.
  - https://github.com/JBlitzar/genetic-graphs/blob/main/moduledag.py

- JBlitzar/adversarial-attacks -- Adversarial Image Construction:

  - Examining the limitations of CNNs by creating adversarial examples. Coded from scratch in Python with Pytorch.
  - https://github.com/JBlitzar/adversarial-attacks/blob/main/README.md
  - https://github.com/JBlitzar/adversarial-attacks/blob/main/NOTES.txt

- Computer vision for FTC

  - (link to publicized repo TODO)

- Symbolic computation: derivative calculator

  - Essentially a derivative calculator. I created my own symbolic computation framework and applied knowledge from my calculus courses to recursively and symbolically (like a human, rather than estimating numerically) evaluate complex derivatives. Coded from scratch in Python with no external libraries.
  - https://github.com/JBlitzar/derivative/blob/main/modules.py
  - https://github.com/JBlitzar/derivative

- LangChain builder

  - TODO track down and add repo

- JBlitzar/saliency -- Saliency Maps for AI Explainability:

  - Utilizes gradient-based methods for explainability. This tool allows you to see which parts of the image the model is most “paying attention to,” minimizing spurious correlation and overfitting. Coded from scratch in Python with Pytorch.
  - https://github.com/JBlitzar/saliency

- **JBlitzar/code-completion** -- Transformer-based Code Completion Model:

  - Inspired by state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT, I created a transformer from scratch with Pytorch, implementing everything, including the attention mechanisms, myself.
  - https://github.com/JBlitzar/code-completion/blob/main/architecture.py
  - https://github.com/JBlitzar/code-completion

- JBlitzar/chest-xray -- NIH Chest X-ray Dataset Pneumonia Classification:

  - I created a simple CNN to classify images from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset as either having or not having pneumonia. I was able to get 95% training accuracy and 82% validation accuracy.
  - https://github.com/JBlitzar/chest-xray

- JBlitzar/inpainting -- Inpainting U-net Model:

  - I coded an inpainting U-net model that reconstructs images when given missing data. Coded from scratch in Python with Pytorch.

- Visualizing Chemical Structures in 3D Space:
  - I applied VSEPR rules that I learned in Chemistry class in order to create an application that generates and visualizes models of molecules in 3D space. I programmed it in Javascript using p5js and WEBGL.
